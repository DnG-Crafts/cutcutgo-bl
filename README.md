# cutcutgo-bl: an open-source bootloader for Cricut Maker3

## Bootloader features

This bootloader lets you flash Cricut Maker3 firmware over USB. When it runs, it appears on the computer as a mass-storage drive, and you drag and drop a compatible firmware file (UF2 format) onto it.

When no application is installed, the bootloader starts the drive automatically and waits for a UF2 file.

Only UF2 firmware files are supported.

This branch is a port to the **Cricut Maker 3** (main board SCM-84-100-X7, **PIC32MK1024MCF100**). It is built and tested on that machine. The original bootloader, for the Cricut Maker's PIC32MX, is [virtualabs/cutcutgo-bl](https://github.com/virtualabs/cutcutgo-bl).

## Using it on the Maker 3

| Action | How |
|---|---|
| Power on | Hold **Power** for about 3 s. |
| Enter update mode | Hold **Pause** while powering on. Update mode also starts by itself when no firmware is installed. |
| Update the firmware | Copy a `.uf2` file onto the drive that appears. |
| Leave update mode without updating | Hold **Power** for about 4 s (only while no upload is in progress). |

The **Power** ring shows what is happening:

| Power ring | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Red | Waiting for a file |
| Purple | Firmware blocks being written |
| Red | All blocks written; the bootloader restarts into the new firmware about a second later |

The bootloader waits until the computer has finished writing before it restarts. That stops Windows from reporting the drive as missing (error 0x800701B1) at the end of the copy.

## How to build

Two ways, both producing a `.hex` file that you program into the chip with a PIC programmer (ICSP):

- **Command line:** `./build.sh` (Git Bash). Needs XC32 (tested with v5.10) and the `PIC32MK-MC_DFP` pack (tested with 1.11.151). Set `XC32_DIR` and `DFP_DIR` if they are not in the default MPLAB X locations. The output is `build/cutcutgo_bl_pic32mk1024mcf100.hex`.
- **MPLAB X:** open the `cutcutgo_bl.X` project. The GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/build.yml`) builds it the same way and publishes the hex as a pre-release named `latest`.

`tools/hex2uf2.py` converts an application `.hex` into a `.uf2` the bootloader accepts.

## Application requirements

- Link the application to start at `0x9D010000`: the bootloader jumps there.
- Do not use the first 64 KB of program flash.
- Build the UF2 with family ID **`0x4d4b4d43`** ("MKMC").

Firmware built for the original Maker's PIC32MX uses a different family ID (`0x4d414b52`) and is rejected.

## PIC32MK1024MCF100 port

### What changed from the PIC32MX build

| Area | PIC32MX (original) | PIC32MK1024MCF100 |
|---|---|---|
| Config folder | `src/config/pic32mx470_curiosity` | `src/config/pic32mk_mcf100` |
| Clocks | PLL and USB PLL set by config bits | SYSCLK 120 MHz from config bits; USB PLL (48 MHz) set at run time in `UPLLCON` |
| Oscillator | fixed in config bits | set in `clock_config.h` (`BOARD_POSC_MHZ` = 8/12/24, crystal or EC). Default: 12 MHz crystal |
| Flash ops | NVMOP codes for MX, `NVMDATA` | MK NVMOP codes, `NVMDATA0`. Page 4 KB / row 512 B (same as MX) |
| Interrupts | `_FCE_VECTOR`, IRQ map for MX | `_FLASH_CONTROL_VECTOR` (31), `_USB_1_VECTOR` (34), MK IRQ map |
| Linker | `p32MX470F512H.ld` | `p32MK1024MCF100.ld`, bootloader limited to 64 KB |
| App flash window | `0x1D010000`-`0x1D080000` | `0x1D010000`-`0x1D100000` (1 MB part) |
| UF2 family ID | `0x4d414b52` ("MAKR") | `0x4d4b4d43` ("MKMC") |
| Button hold timing | busy-loop counts | core timer (3 s at boot, 4 s to reset) |
| End of upload | reset straight after the last block | waits for the last block to be acknowledged and the PC to stop writing |

### Pins (Cricut Maker 3 main board SCM-84-100-X7)

Buttons (all active low, with pull-ups on the board):

| Button | Pin |
|---|---|
| Power | RF13 |
| Load/Unload | RF12 |
| Play | RE15 |
| Pause | RE14 |

LEDs (all active high):

| LED | Pin |
|---|---|
| Power ring, white | RB7 |
| Power ring, red | RC10 |
| Power ring, blue | RD15 |
| Load/Unload, white | RD12 |
| Play, white | RD13 |
| Pause, blue | RD14 |

The white carriage light is on RG7 (on when driven low). The bootloader doesn't use it.

**Never drive RB10:** it moves the blade-down actuator. It was the "pause LED" in the original PIC32MX Cricut Maker pin map.

USB uses the USB1 module (D1+/D1-, pins 57/56), with VBUS sensing on pin 54. On this chip the USB PLL "ready" flag (`CLKSTAT.UPLLRDY`) never sets, even though USB works, so the clock code gives the PLLs a fixed time to lock rather than waiting for it.

### Not done

- The MCC/Harmony project files (`.mc3`, `.mhc`) for the MX470 were removed. The config code was ported by hand, so regenerating it with MCC is not set up.
